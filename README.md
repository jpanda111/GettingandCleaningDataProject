to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

## Step One: Merge the training and test sets to create one data set 
### using cbind to consolidate test data and train data indivually
  * test data: X_test, y_test, subject_test
  * train data: X_train, y_train, subject_train
### using rbind to merge train and test data together  

## Step Two: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
